# Rock Paper Scissors



## Learning JavaScript
This project is simply an in-browser game of rock, paper, scissors. 

The underlying purpose of this project is to implement what was learned about JavaScript "so far" in the Odin Project - JavaScript fundamentals course.

## How to Use
This game is played exclusively in the browser's console.

To open the game:
1. Open the Developer Tools in your console (usually F12). If you don't know how to open the Developer Tools, please search how to do so for your respective browser.
2. In the Developer Tools pane, search for the Console tab.
